### The probelm:
By the year 2100, the world need of food is expected to reach its peak due to continuous exponential increase of human population all over the world, exceeding 9 billion human beings with basic need “Food” as the main global attention. On a hand the first proposal to overcome now and future food needs, the production rates must reach a percentage of 70 by the year 2050. On the other hand, plant/s pandemic/s reduce the expected crop yield production with an estimation of 40%, what is leading to a complete loss of outcomes, especially in distinct and far places where plant creatures superior and oracle knowledge in form of guidance doesn’t exist.

### Description
The main issue is trying to help farmers know the diseases type that affect their plants and knowing the appropriate treatment for each disease as soon as possible.
The Application presents an experienced community where people can help each other in the faced problems. 
* [Identification of the disease: ](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) The user will be able to capture/upload a plant leaf image with his smart phone to know if it is infected or not. The application analyzes the image and return to him the results of its analysis and suggests a treatment if it was infected.
* [Applying ML model algorithms and classifiers: ](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+)they showed promising results in image classification and decision-making to assist farmers to diagnose the plant diseases, which will serve as a boost in improving plant care services through effective image analysis of symptoms (pests) suffered by the plant.

* [Helping/Asking others for help: ](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) the user who wants an advice on his plant or anything related to the plant he is interested in can ask a general question (post) to all users and other users will respond to him.

* [Fertilization: ](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) Calculating the appropriate amount of fertilizer for the agricultural area; some plants suffer from a lack or increase in the used fertilizer percentage, so the application will provide the correct standards that user can use in the agricultural area to obtain the best fertilization plan.
